# Skimlit Auxiliary
Auxiliary functions for the skimlit model escalation and training. 
# Dataset
The dataset used on is the [Pubmed RTC Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071). In order to download it, one can run the ```download_pumbed_rtc.sh``` script.
# Training Environment 
The training script and the python dependencies are made to train the model on a Jetson Nano. For installing Tensorflow2 in the Jetson Nano refet to [NVIDIA's Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/install-tf-jetson-platform/index.html) on the topic.
